# Problem Statement
* New guideline lowers the maximum value for THMs at the customer tap to 0.20 mg/l.
* This report reviews historical data to assess the risk of non-compliance.
* Assumes no operational changes are implemented. 

# Methodology
::::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
* Monthly samples are taken from customer taps in each town.
* Data avalable between `r min(thm$Date)` and `r max(thm$Date)`.
* Fields:
    * `Sample_No`: Number of the sample
    * `Date`: Date the sample was taken
    * `Sample_Point`: Sample point asset number
    * `Town`: Town
    * `Result`: Test result

# Exploratory Analysis
```{r}
thm_count <- count(thm, Town, name = "Samples")
kable(thm_count, caption = "Summary sample numbers.")
```

# Analysis
```{r}
ggplot(thm, aes(Town, Result)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = .2, col = "red", linetype = "longdash") + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_dark() + 
  labs(title = "THM Results",
       subtitle = "Gormsey") 
```

# Summary
```{r}
exceedances <- filter(thm, Result > 0.2)
```

* `r nrow(exceedances)` samples exceeded the proposed new limit in `r unique(exceedances$Town)`
* Further investigation required to determine the cause.
