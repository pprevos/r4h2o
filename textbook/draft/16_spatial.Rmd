# Spatial Analysis {#spatial}

Water services are delivered in an exchange with the natural environment, which was visualised in figure \@ref(fig:supply-chain). This means that all water data is somehow tied to the earth and thus has a spatial dimension.

Water quality data relies on samples taken at a point in time and space. and customers consume water in their house or any other building. All data that reports on the performance of the water cycle is as such spatial.

This last case study looks at how to visualise and analyse spatial data, from simple plots to more complex geodesic transformations.

The R language has extensive capabilities, through various libraries, to visualise and analyse spatial data in various formats.

## Simple spatial visualisation

- add list of sample points to Gormsey
- Print on png background
- Reduce number of Towns on Gormsey
